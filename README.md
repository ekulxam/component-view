Shows components for ItemStacks
Also known as WTHITC (What The Heck Is That Component)

This is a simple client-side mod which allows you to see an itemstack's components (which are displayed in the tooltip when the mod is installed).

This mod is configurable through Mod Menu and YetAnotherConfigLib, but will work without them being installed.

Controls:
- Enable advanced tooltips (configurable) or press shift, control, or alt (shift, command, or option on Mac) to display components
- Press shift to see the component types and values in a new light, literally (colors configurable)
- Press control or alt (command or option on Mac) to attempt to translate the component types via identifier (configurable). This doesn't do anything yet because components don't have translation keys.
