Shows components for ItemStacks
Also known as WTHITC (What The Heck Is That Component)

This is a simple client-side mod which allows you to see an itemstack's components (which are displayed in the tooltip when the mod is installed).

This mod is configurable through Mod Menu and YetAnotherConfigLib, but will work without them being installed.
